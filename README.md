nube
====

A cloud scripting server based in Google V8 and Boost libraries. The idea is to use threads + Asio for
the service part and a V8 isolate inside each thread to execute arbitrary Javascript code.

In order to kickstart this project quickly I'm ussing massive amount of libboost and ather code and examples.

Nube means cloud in Spanish.
