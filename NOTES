Requirements:
Boost 1.41
GLog (Google's C++ log facility) 0.3.3

Notes:
I'd like to keep the logging as simple as possible. Maybe implementing a simple log (see header log.hpp)
This will require using boost::mutex for atomic thread safe operations.

The whole code required review even for achieving at least a beta level.
